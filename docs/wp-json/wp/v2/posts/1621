Our working groups provide opportunities for digital library practitioners to collaborate and get stuff done by using DLF as a framework for action. As robust communities of practice, DLF groups embody our mission by strengthening connections among digital library practitioners engaged in work around policy advocacy, professional standards, ethics, issues of representation and diversity, labor, equity and inclusion, and other matters of concern to digital library practitioners and the people and publics we serve.<\/p><p>Participation in DLF\u2019s working groups is open to all who are interested, regardless of affiliation with a DLF member institution. During the afternoons on Monday and Tuesday, and on Wednesday morning during the Forum week, attendees are cordially invited to join our working group meetups to find out what makes the #DLFvillage such an engaging, passionate, and supportive community.<\/p><p><strong>Working Group Session A<\/strong><br \/><strong>November 1, 3:30pm ET<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>Assessment Interest Group<\/strong><br \/>Led by Jennifer Bradshaw, Kate Flynn, Joy Perrin, Suzanne Preate, Hannah Scates Kettler, Hannah Tarver, Santi Thompson, Rachel White, and Shannon Willis<\/p><p>Join participants in the DLF Assessment Interest Group (AIG) for AIG 101.

The CEI meets year-round, with its work divided between providing support for DLF Events and serving as a community of practice. We aim to create a space where community members can share expertise, develop frameworks for inclusive practices, and produce knowledge and documentation to be made openly available. The CEI is composed of both standing sub-groups and short-term project groups. Standing sub-groups focus on broader diversity issues within GLAM. Project groups respond to the immediate needs of the forum or to meet more exigent, terminal requests from the community (webinars, toolkits, or other resources). The current sub-groups consist of: the Advocacy, Recruitment, &amp; Leadership Programming Subgroup; the GLAM DEI Subgroup, and the Inclusivity at the Forum Subgroup. There is also a dedicated project group dedicated to producing documentation and updating our wiki. During this session, attendees will be provided with an overview of the work done by the CEI and its sub-groups and project groups, its mission, and its plans for the next year. There will be time reserved for Q&amp;A, feedback from the community, and general dialog around diversity concerns within GLAM.<\/p><p><strong>Digital Library Pedagogy Group<\/strong><br \/>Led by Alex Wermer-Colan and Heidi Winkler<\/p><p>The DLF Digital Library Pedagogy Working Group, affectionately known as #DLFteach, is a grassroots community of practice formed following the 2015 DLF Forum. We empower digital library practitioners to see themselves as teachers and equip teaching librarians to engage learners in how digital library technologies shape our knowledge infrastructure. Our group is open to anyone interested in learning about or collaborating on digital library pedagogy. In 2019, we published the #DLFteach Toolkit, an openly available, peer-reviewed collection of lesson plans and concrete instructional strategies focused on digital library instruction. During the 2021 DLF Forum, we are excited to introduce you to #DLFteach Toolkit Volume 2: Lesson Plans on Immersive Pedagogy, which focuses on lesson plans to facilitate disciplinary and interdisciplinary work engaged with 3D technology. Please plan to visit our other session, Immersive Pedagogy: Distant Learning in Virtual Reality with Mozilla Hubs, to learn more about the exciting work our authors have done [link to session]. During our live group session at this year\u2019s Forum, we invite conference attendees to join us for a casual, \u201coffice hours\u201d style chat about what #DLFteach has been up to, our plans for 2022, and ways for you to get involved. We would love to hear from you about what digital pedagogy tools you\u2019ve been experimenting with and what you would want to learn more about. If you are unable to join our working group session but want to share what you\u2019ve been working on, please fill out this survey: https:\/\/forms.gle\/QvhPck5NMhXBAvdQ9.

Since 2015, the Museums Cohort has worked to build a community of those working on digital preservation, collections, exhibition development, museum libraries management, rights management, teaching, user engagement and more. Join #DLFmuseums for their November meeting at the DLF Forum. Opening the meeting, DLF\u2019s program associate, Gayle Schechter, will provide a brief overview of the Cohort and opportunities for community involvement as well as take feedback from the group on community interests to guide planning and programming for the year ahead. The Cohort then hosts a brief presentation from community member Sumitra Duncan, head of the Web Archiving Program, New York Art Resources Consortium (NYARC)\/web archive lead, Frick Art Reference Library. Duncan will be joined by their colleagues from the Internet Archive, Lori Donovan, Community Programs Manager, Web Archiving &amp; Data Services and Madeline Carruthers, Program Officer, Community Programs, to discuss the joint Internet Archive\/NYARC project, Consortial Action to Preserve Born-Digital, Web-Based Art History &amp; Culture. The project recently received a two-year, $305,343 Humanities Collections and Reference Resources grant from the Division of Preservation and Access at the National Endowment for the Humanities to support the formation of a cooperative group of 30+ art and museum libraries from across the United States to collaborate on the preservation of, and access to vital arts content from the web.<\/p><p><strong>Working Group on Privacy &amp; Ethics in Technology<\/strong><br \/>Led by Eliza Bettinger, Michelle Gibeault, and Paige Walker<\/p><p>First, PET will briefly present and discuss our group\u2019s new values statement, produced through collaboration with the PET community. Anyone who subscribes to these values and wants to advocate for them in their institutions is welcome to join the group. The second part of the session will introduce PET members who are already doing technical, educational, or policy work related to privacy in their institutions, and have offered to act as a \u201cPrivacy Peer\u201d to others. PET\u2019s aim is to act as a mutual aid network to library workers who advocate for privacy in our libraries. But sometimes it can be hard for individuals to know where to start! A Privacy Peer can help you strategize your next (or first!) privacy moves in your library, and identify further resources or people to support you. Come meet folks who have learned some things from experience and who are eager to share what they know and learn from your situation, too.<\/p>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Though the annual Forum is considered DLF\u2019s signature event, throughout the year a committed community gravitates to us from within and beyond DLF\u2019s institutional membership working across boundaries of many kinds and making the Digital Library Federation a force for good.
